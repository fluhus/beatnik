# Beatnik

Beatnik is a **drum programming language**.

## What Does it Do?

With Beatnik you can type **text** which describes your beat, and Beatnik will interpret it and turn in into **MIDI**.

## Getting Started

1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/fluhus/beatnik/releases) and download the relevant file. It contains two executables: `btnk` and `gui`.
2. Read the [tutorial](https://github.com/fluhus/beatnik/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md).
3. Start making beats using `btnk` with the command line, or `gui` with your browser.

### `btnk`

`btnk` is a command line compiler that turns Beatnik code (typically with .btn suffix) into MIDI files.

From the command line run:

```
btnk file1.btn file2.btn
```

`btnk` will create file1.btn.mid and file2.btn.mid.

### `gui`

`gui` is a graphical web interface. Once you run it you can open your browser at the address it shows on the terminal.

This is an experimental thing I did for demonstration purposes. Would love to get feedback on where to take it further!
